A victory for Mr Raisi on Friday was vital for \"the preservation of the interests of the people, the revolution and the country\", he warned. Mr Qalibaf had been under pressure from the clerical establishment to drop out. Hardliners reportedly feared the anti-Rouhani vote would be split and make a second round run-off more likely. In the last election in 2013, the former Revolutionary Guards commander and police chief came a distant second to Mr Rouhani with 16.5% of the vote. In a statement published by state media on Monday, Mr Qalibaf wrote that he was withdrawing his candidacy in an attempt to put an end to President Rouhani's \"inefficient and impotent\" administration. \"A fundamental and crucial decision must be taken",

    "The 23-year-old vanished while on a night out with friends on 24 September in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. Suffolk Police officers combing through CCTV footage have released stills of three people who have yet to be traced. Mr Mckeague, from Dunfermline in Fife, was last seen walking alone in Bury St Edmunds at about 03:25 BST. He walked into a dead-end area known as the \"horseshoe\" and was not seen again. Following a previous appeal, police still need to trace two people shown on CCTV - a cyclist and an older man. A name had been given for the older man, but this person has since been traced and he was not the man in the image. A third picture has also been released. It is a better image of a potential witness, believed to have featured in pictures previously released on 8 December. All of the footage was filmed in Bury St Edmunds town centre between 03.15",
    "The strategy has been developed following a critical report from the Care Inspectorate. It concluded that youngsters were not being adequately protected. Former chief constable, Pat Shearer, who is interim chairman of the child protection committee, said no time was being wasted in making improvements. Inspectors warned earlier this year that they were \"not confident\" that vulnerable children and young people in Dumfries and Galloway were being kept safe. Their report called for urgent action to ensure that they were protected and their needs met. Mr Shearer said: \"We have reviewed every plan for every child on the child protection register and we are going deeper than that. \"Modifications are taking place every day in that respect. \"We are clear about the key issues.\" He said it was important that the initial process when a concern came in worked as well as possible.

    "They say the 12.4 sq km section is among the largest ever witnessed to come away from the ice stream's calving front. Satellite imagery suggests the break-up occurred sometime between 13 and 19 August. Jakobshavn is a major drainage channel for the Greenland ice sheet, producing roughly 10% of its icebergs. Once discarded, the ice travels down a long fjord before entering the Davis Strait and heading towards the Atlantic. It is widely speculated that the source of the berg that sank the Titanic was Jakobshavn. Scientists say the glacier moves at tens of metres a day in Summer months, making it one of the fastest flowing ice streams in Greenland, if not the fastest.

Not only can it see through cloud, it can also be used to map flow and elevation changes. The Sentinel-2a satellite is Europe's new optical spacecraft and can provide context",
    "Engineers worked throughout the night to repair the damage to the line near Peterborough and minimise delays to services into London's King's Cross. The problem has now been fixed, and National Rail said all knock-on delays had now finished. Those affected by the problem were East Coast, First Capital Connect, First Hull Trains and Grand Central. Several First Capital Connect trains were cancelled while others were delayed by up to two hours. Some East Coast services were delayed by up to four hours. The problem developed just after 18:00 BST on Monday between Peterborough and Stevenage, causing huge delays for many travellers. The disruption mainly affected passengers who were heading south.

Judges threw out Shahid's appeal after concluding Zahid had lied. Zahid was jailed for another six years after he admitted attempting to defeat the ends of justice. He is already serving a minimum of 17 years after being found guilty of abducting and murdering the schoolboy. The additional sentence, which will begin when the minimum term ends, means it could be 2027 before he is freed. Three other men - Imran Shahid, his brother Zeeshan Shahid and Faisal Mushtaq - were also jailed for life for the murder after being convicted in 2006.

People who want to give evidence, and have not been invited, need to express their interest by 18 May. The panel is hearing evidence from residents and businesses on the estate, as well as developers, the regeneration team, councillors and council officers. It is investigating actions taken by the council, but is not considering the merits of the overall scheme. Residents opposing the plans have described them as not regeneration but a complete rebuild of Sheerwater, which they said was not what they wanted or expected. The estate was originally built after World War Two, to house families that relocated from London. Residents have been promised new housing, a retail centre, leisure centre, sports facilities, park, public square, community facilities",

    "Vehicles were allowed on to the eastbound carriageway of the new M8 for the first time on Sunday, a week after the westbound carriageway opened. It means the entire stretch between Edinburgh and Glasgow is now motorway. The works were the latest stage in the \u00c2\u00a3500m M8, M73 and M74 motorway improvements project. The completion of the missing link means drivers no longer need to use the old A8 between Newhouse and Baillieston.

John Hancock, from the POA, said members were \"totally burnt out\". He said: \"It's not just [prisoner] protests, violence and assaults against staff have hugely increased and there are assaults on other inmates as well. \"It's becoming so dangerous that staff have concerns about how prisons and Channings Wood are being run.\" The Ministry of Justice said: \"Channings Wood continues to be a safe and decent prison. \"In its most recent inspection it was described as safe and calm with low levels of violence.\"",
    "A report has concluded that the method of extracting oil and gas potentially poses health risks. \"Relying on the limited data presently available would be negligent on my part,\" said state Health Commissioner Howard Zucker. Vermont is the only other US state to ban fracking. New York has had a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing since 2008 when it initiated an environmental review of the process. The potential for fracking in the state is considerable as the large Marcellus shale deposit is partly located under it. Commissioner Zucker said he had identified ``significant public health risks'' that prevented him approving the technique. Environmental groups welcomed the decision. But representatives of the oil and gas industry criticised the move, suggesting the state would miss out on the creation of thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said it was the most emotionally charged issue he had dealt with, even compared to gay marriage or the death penalty.",

    "The UN recommended that the UK \"put an end to corporal punishment in all settings\" and encourage non-violent forms of discipline instead. A government spokeswoman said they did not wish to \"criminalise parents for issuing a mild smack\". The report also urged the UK to review counter-terrorism powers and raise the age of criminal responsibility from 10. They were among the recommendations issued by the UN Human Rights Committee, which has published an assessment of legal and cultural issues in the UK. The report said the government \"should take practical steps\" including \"legislative measures where appropriate\" to end corporal punishment. It suggested the government should \"conduct public information campaigns to raise awareness about its harmful effects\". Under current laws \"reasonable chastisement\" to control a child's behaviour is allowed, but parents can be prosecuted if their actions result in injuries such as bruises, cuts or scratches.

Kovalev is one of the most feared punchers in boxing, while American Ward is one of the most skilful. \"If Kovalev makes any mistakes I will make him pay. He can be dropped and he can be knocked out,\" said Ward. \"We will see who is the puncher.

Terfel, who the theatre will be named after, said the goal was to have a venue of \"high standards - and not to rush to finish everything quickly\". On Monday, it emerged Bangor University was warned Pontio could be delayed and run over budget six months before it cancelled the opening production. Terfel told BBC Wales' Cymru Fyw: \"Obviously there is disappointment for many about the delay in opening the theatre in Bangor, \"On the other hand, we need to take a step back and take time for the good of the staff, the artists, the audience, and the visitors. \"The goal is to have a theatre of high standards - and not rush to finish",

Director of rugby Richard Cockerill told BBC Radio Leicester: \"It will certainly be weeks, potentially leading to months, rather than days.\" The 22-year-old is now a major doubt for all of England's autumn Tests. Australia, Argentina and New Zealand all visit Twickenham in November \"Until we know exactly what the damage is, it is hard to tell how long it will be,\" Cockerill added. England have already lost Brad Barritt, Tuilagi's regular centre partner over the last year. The Saracens player has been ruled out after foot surgery.

Allardyce's side remain 19th in the table, four points from safety and with the worst defensive record in the league. But the ex-West Ham manager remains optimistic after bolstering his squad in the January transfer window. \"Never ever say die. You've got to go until the end,\" he added. \"I'm really pleased about the new guys coming in from abroad into the side, \"Hopefully they're going to drag the rest of the players along with them with their bit of extra quality.\"",
    "Wilson, 24, outplayed Allen to lead 7-1 after the first session but the world number seven responded by taking the first four frames of the next. The Northern Irishman knocked in two century breaks in the first two frames of Sunday evening's play. Kettering's Wilson hit back to secure the final four frames of the session. Wilson punished a series of poor Allen safety shots as breaks of 50, 55, 93 and 103 helped him win the first seven frames of the best of 25-contest at the Crucible Theatre. Allen, who won his third ranking event, the Players Championship, last month, took the final frame of the morning session and looked transformed as he reeled off four in a row to mount a stirring comeback. Wilson scored just one point in the first three frames of the night, with Allen compiling breaks of 122, 103 and 60. A further break of 66 enabled the 2009 semi-finalist to reduce his deficit to two at the mid-session interval. The Shanghai Masters",

The Ipsos mori poll of 1,000 adults found one in four readers preferred crime fiction. One in 10 opted for science fiction and biography, while historic fiction was the preferred choice of 9% of readers.

Banks charge a monthly fee for such accounts, but some people say they have been signed up without their permission - or have found the insurance products worthless. \"This is the second half-year running that we have seen complaints about banking products rise,\" said Christopher Woolard, the FCA's director of strategy and competition. \"It is clear that firms need to look at the causes for this rise, and where necessary take action to address the causes of the trend.\" Last month the Financial Ombudsman Service - which handles complaints that cannot be resolved - said that the number of people unhappy about",

Spa faces a challenge from Japan's Suzuka for the claim to be the world's greatest race track, but nowhere rivals Monza for atmosphere.

Insights from behavioural sciences are often touted by politicians as a powerful way to try to persuade society to change behaviour. Lord Krebs used his address to highlight those areas where such an approach has been successful. However, he also argued that \"they are not a 'get out of jail free card' for governments if government wants to avoid tougher approaches like regulation or taxation\".

    "By a vote of 86-12, the Senate approved a 90-day extension of wiretaps, access to business records and surveillance of terror suspects. The move came one day after the House of Representatives voted to extend the provisions until 8 December. The White House backed the bill, but would have favoured a longer extension. The House and Senate must now reach a compromise on extending the surveillance powers, which are set to expire on 28 February. The brief extension gives those in Congress a chance to review the measures that some claim are unconstitutional infringements on personal liberties. The provisions covered under the bill give the US government the authority for \"roving surveillance\" of suspects who might be able to thwart investigative methods that ordinarily require a judge's warrant. They also give federal investigators access to business records with a warrant from a secret national security court and grant federal law enforcement greater power to watch foreign so-called \"lone wolf\" terror suspects.

Karen went missing from a children's home in 1981 and when her body was found, it was so badly decomposed it was impossible to establish the cause of her death. Lawyers for the men argued during their appeal that evidence from the key witness in the trial - a girl from the same children's home as Karen who was known only as D - could not be",

Listing a site as \"in danger\" can help address threats by, for example, unlocking access to funds or publicity. Australia welcomed the decision as support for its conservation measures, but Unesco also made criticisms. The ruling was made at a Unesco World Heritage Committee meeting in Poland. Australian Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg described it as a \"big win\" for his nation. \"We are taking every action possible to ensure this great wonder of the world stays viable and healthy for future generations to come,\" he told an Australian Broadcasting Corp radio programme. In its draft decision released earlier this week, Unesco said Australia had taken several significant steps to preserve the reef under its Reef 2050 Plan. However, it criticised Australia's slow progress in improving water quality, noting some conservation targets were \"not expected to be achieved within the foreseen timeframe\". The heritage",

Mr Turnbull called Israel a \"miraculous nation\" in a warm meeting with Mr Netanyahu on Wednesday. Mr Netanyahu thanked Australia for defending his nation against UN resolutions.

China recently revised down its 2014 economic growth from 7.4% to 7.3%, its weakest for almost 25 years. In US dollar denominated terms, exports for the month of August fell 5.5% from a year earlier - slightly less than expected - while imports fell by 13.8%, leaving China with a surplus of $60.24bn.

    "Developers who sell their apps through Apple earned a record $20bn in 2016, up 40% on the previous year. Games dominated App Store's bestsellers, including Pokemon Go and Nintendo's Super Mario Run. Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw, said in-app purchases, such as paying to upgrade a character, drove the rise. Since 2008, when the App Store first launched, developers have earned a total $60bn in revenue. Last year alone accounted for $20bn, or a third of total sales. Mr Dawson attributed the acceleration to a relatively new business model where people download a game app for their iPhone or iPad for free, then pay to buy additional features such as opening secret levels or new powers. In 2016, Apple also also changed its revenue sharing deal with developers of subscription apps such as Netflix or HBO",
    "Sid Ahmed Ghlam, a 24-year-old Algerian national, was detained on Sunday in Paris after he apparently shot himself by accident and called an ambulance. He is also being questioned over the murder of a woman on Sunday. France has stepped up security in the wake of recent attacks on the Charlie Hebdo offices and a Jewish supermarket. Ghlam was known to security services as having expressed a wish to travel to Syria to fight with Islamist militants, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said. When police arrived at the scene on Sunday, they followed a trail of blood to the suspect's car, where they found weapons and notes on potential targets. The documents established \"beyond doubt\" that Ghlam planned on attacking churches, said Mr Cazeneuve. \"Several war weapons, hand guns, ammunition [and] bullet-proof vests,\" were found in his car and home, the minister added. Documents linked to al-Qaeda and Islamic State were also found",
    "Members of the GMB, Unite and Prospect unions rejected an offer from Dounreay Site Restoration Limited (DSRL) of a 1% increase in pay in October last year. The unions said \"crisis talks\" with DSRL on Thursday ended without a resolution and a timetable for a ballot on industrial action was \"imminent\". DSRL has said the offer was \"comparable\" to other pay rises. The unions said industrial action would suspend all work at the site. Dounreay, near Thurso in Caithness, is being decommissioned. Built in the 1950s, it was an experimental nuclear power site. The unions argue that DSRL's parent company, Cavendish Dounreay Partnership, could afford to make a better offer on pay because of the profits it has been making. In a statement, DSRL said: \"We have made what we believe to be an improved offer to the trade unions and, although disappointed that we have not yet reached agreement, we remain",

    "The men and boys were killed in an explosion at Sneyd Colliery in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, on New Year's Day in 1942. Official records at the time concluded the blast it was caused by a spark from loaded wagons igniting coal dust at the colliery. The service at Holy Trinity Church in Burslem was held on Sunday afternoon. Miners did not usually work on 1 January because of an old superstition, but they had gone down the pit to help with the war effort. Keith Meeson, 71, from Stanley, campaigned for a memorial for the victims, near the Town Hall in Burslem town centre, which he said was unveiled in 2007.

But the projection, published in the Times and based on YouGov research, suggests a possible hung parliament. Sterling fell more than half a percent against the US dollar to $1.28. The Times said the YouGov data suggests the Tories could lose up to 20 of the 330 seats they held in the last parliament, with Labour gaining nearly 30 seats. The Conservatives would still be the biggest party, but would not have an overall majority. The model is based on 50,000 interviews over a week, with voters from a panel brought together by YouGov It uses a new \"constituency-by-constituency\" model for polling, which the paper says allows for big variations.

The North has issued a series of increasingly bellicose threats in the wake of sanctions imposed after nuclear and missile tests earlier this year.

The anniversary has been marked with the launch of a year-long programme of events celebrating \"the past, present and future of Jodrell Bank's science, engineering and heritage\", a spokeswoman said. In April, the site was chosen as the worldwide headquarters for the Square Kilometre Array project, which will probe the early universe, test the theory of gravity and even search for alien life. Prof O'Brien said that achievement was a direct result of Sir Bernard's work, as he pioneered a \"whole new science [through which] we discovered a whole new universe out there, full of super massive black holes, exploding stars and the fading glow",

    "About 32 miles (51km) between London and Theale, Berkshire, would be widened in both directions to four lanes, using the hard shoulder. Some motorists and the RAC have said the lack of a hard shoulder would leave motorists in a vulnerable position if there was a breakdown. The Highways Agency said there would be refuges for broken down vehicles. Senior project manager Andrew Hitch said converting the hard shoulder into a lane would also discourage motorists from stopping for non-emergencies, such as to answer their phones. Smart motorways also use a range of new technology, including electronic signs, to vary speed limits in response to driving conditions. They are managed and monitored by the Highways Agency's regional control centres using CCTV.

Foreigners are free to mark the Christian holiday in their own homes, but hotels and other public places have been prohibited from marking the day. \"Having Muslims celebrate Christmas in Somalia is not the right thing, such things are akin to the abandonment,\" local media quote Mohamed Kheyrow, a top official at Somalia's justice and religious affairs ministry, as saying. Correspondents say as the country recovers from years of civil war, a growing number of Somalis who grew up in the diaspora are returning home, some of them bringing Western customs with them.

He was jailed for nine months, fined \u00c2\u00a3400 and banned for three years. Dumfries Sheriff Court heard that Peoples, who had changed his name from Ballard to try to put a series of crimes behind him, wanted to be imprisoned to allow his continued rehabilitation. He admitted driving dangerously and driving while banned and without insurance. Solicitor David Finnie said Peoples had a catalogue of offending over the years and had changed his name, taking on his mother's maiden name, in a bid to reform.

But the five-time World Cup winners complained that Raul Ruidiaz's 75th-minute winner at the Gillette Stadium in Massachusetts went in off his hand. \"It was such a clear handball,\" said World Cup-winning captain Dunga. Brazil's players protested to Uruguayan referee Andres Cunha, but he decided to stand by his decision after consulting with the fourth official. The result left Brazil third in Group B, behind Peru and Ecuador, who both qualify for the quarter-finals. Peru will now play Colombia, while Ecuador face the United States, who are hosting the tournament. Dunga, who took charged after the 2014 World Cup, is due to lead his country at their home Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in August.

A Red Cross worker later found out that the man's wallet had been stolen in Stuttgart. But instead of going to the police the man registered as a migrant. A Mandarin speaker solved the puzzle. The translator was found at a Chinese restaurant near the migrant hostel where the tourist was staying, in Duelmen, near the west German city of Dortmund. In early July the tourist arrived at the hostel on a bus with migrants, from Dortmund. \"He was so different from the others. Very, very helpless,\" said Red Cross worker Christoph Schluetermann.

It suggested children who are hard of hearing struggle in classrooms with poor acoustics and a lack of understanding by staff. Parents said their child's deafness \"had a major impact\" in the school day. The small, online questionnaire revealed children with limited hearing were \"falling behind\" in mainstream schools, compared with their peers. The vast majority of the parents questioned (86%) had partially deaf children in mainstream schools. They said their children struggled in classrooms with background noise or trying to understand speech from a distance. One-third of parents blamed a lack of staff awareness of their child's mild or moderate deafness for their difficulties. The study said that children could miss up to half of what the teacher said in class, which had an impact on their reading, writing, spelling and spoken language.

    "So-called \"ghost brokers\" sell cheap, but bogus, motor insurance policies, leaving drivers at risk of big bills following accidents. Some 26 cases are being investigated by the industry's team studying large-scale operations. Similar ghost sales are being seen in other industries. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said that unauthorised insurance advisers were touting for business in pubs and clubs. They also advertised in some newsagents, via social media, and on \"professional-looking\" websites. Drivers may be tempted by the cheap prices being offered, but policies were often invalid. This put them at risk of having their vehicles seized or facing prosecution, especially following an accident. The ABI suggests that drivers shop around for a good deal, but check the authorisation and reputation of the provider.

    "The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal would be invested in making more staff available to crew Fire Rescue Units. But the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it would be \"dangerous and reckless\" to get rid of them permanently. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has released three plans to make the savings. It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene. An alternative proposal has been put forward by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore, who recommends putting the 13 fire engines back into service but making savings by establishing alternate crewing at stations with some specialist appliances.

    "The rate of growth marks a sharp slowdown from the 2% growth recorded in the previous quarter. The US Commerce department said one reason for the slower growth was a slowdown in consumer spending. Export growth was also slower as the strong dollar made US goods more expensive outside the country. Energy sector investment continued to plummet, with spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts down 38.7%, a slightly less dramatic fall than the 47% drop seen in the third quarter. Overall, investment in the sector was down 35% in 2015, the largest drop since 1986. Unseasonably mild weather held back some consumer spending, with another brake on growth from manufacturers who needed to run down surplus stock rather than make new goods. Both factors are seen as temporary. Overall, the US economy grew by 2.4% in 2015, and is expected to pick up steam to give a similar growth figure this year. On Wednesday, the US central bank",

She added: \"Women represent 52% of the population in Scotland - yet for too long have been massively underrepresented in Scottish public life.

The victim's brother, Darrell Martin, said: \"There were opportunities to stop the man from driving around.\" Speaking on the Today programme, Mr Martin said: \"The text message - think about how inane this is - it was about meeting his mate later and taking his dog for a walk. That's what killed my brother.\" Mr Martin said he remembers getting the \"distraught\" phone call from his mother telling him his brother had been killed in a cycling accident. He said he remembered thinking he hoped he had been killed because of an \"unavoidable accident\". The Martin family believes Gard should have faced tougher action due to his previous offences of using a",

    "New laws voted in on Wednesday will open the market to foreign oil firms. As a result, state-owned energy group Pemex will lose the monopoly it has held since nationalisation. President Enrique Pena Nieto has made energy reform the cornerstone of his administration. He expects the changes will boost production back to 2004 levels by 2025. Crumbling infrastructure, bureaucracy and corruption have pared Mexican production from 3.6 million barrels a day in 2004 to just 2.5 million. The ending of Pemex's monopoly required changes to the constitution, signed into law last year. The reforms are expected to attract billions of dollars of investment into the country, the world's ninth-largest oil producer. They also authorise private production of electricity. President Pena Nieto tweeted: \"A more competitive and prosperous Mexico.

    "The character is facing two charges - attempted murder and wounding with intent - after she stabbed her husband Rob in a long-running domestic abuse storyline. The soap's editor, Sean O'Connor, promised \"both a shocking and deeply moving trial\". It will run over next week's episodes, hearing the evidence from both sides. The trial will bring to a climax the controversial three-year storyline that saw Rob's (played by Timothy Watson) controlling and abusive behaviour towards Helen (Louiza Patikas) escalate, which culminated in her stabbing him in April. The rural soap will portray the prosecution as hoping to paint a picture of Helen as an unstable and volatile perpetrator and the defence likely to argue that she acted in self-defence, driven by months of abuse and the need to protect her child. Both Helen and Rob are set to testify, with Helen's best friend Kirsty, her mother Pat, her five-year-old son Henry, Rob's mother Ursula and PC Harrison",

Hollis was a 31-year-old sergeant major with the Green Howards when he took part in the assault on Gold Beach. As his company moved inland, he captured several gun positions and rescued two colleagues, taking more than two dozen prisoners in the process.

Earlier this month, the two airlines settled an anti-trust suit brought by the US Justice Department. The Justice Department sued to stop the merger in August, saying it would reduce competition and result in higher prices for consumers.

Officials did not immediately release the victim's name. Mr Scopelliti, 51, was named as a suspect and he surrendered to authorities on Saturday, a police statement said. He later appeared in court where he was charged with first-degree murder. Zito was born in Fiumara, Calabria, Italy, in 1928 and moved to Canada in the mid-1950s. He was reported to have had ties with branches of the 'Ndrangheta in New York, Montreal and Italy. Italian police say",

The agency said each airline would still have to go through an assessment process, ensuring aircraft systems are not affected by the signals from portable electronic devices before establishing their own rules for their operation. As a result there could be a delay in implementing the new rules at some airlines. It also says that airlines may opt for different policies on the use of mobile devices.

But the judge had refused to grant the government an urgent declaration that the strike was unlawful, saying the likely outcome of any trial of the issue was that the NUT's strategy was to protect members' terms and conditions through its campaign.

They are much more likely to take loans, study for jobs while looking for more, sell their business or sell stock if they feel insecure about how they want to continue their career. There is also clear evidence that those in business are much more reluctant to leave than men. The result is that women are not competing for the same jobs, and the economy suffers. It is more likely to be seen as an obstacle that forces men-only jobs and companies to stay closed. \"For the most part the women who have left industry have been younger people with limited business experience,\" said Ms Beynon, of the National Women's Entrepreneur Centre. \"It's almost as if they are seeking a career change; they're wanting more financial stability in their lives and they need to start a",

The Complete Fertility clinic in Southampton is first in the UK to use the Anecdotic, which allows patients to choose whether to have a fertilisation, a vasectomy or neither. The clinic is run by David Greenlee, a doctor who became so passionate about a natural method of birth control through his own family history of cancer that he had a personal crusade to find a way to create a child who could have both. He spent 20 years investigating vasectomies, using human stem cells, as well as studying the effects of drugs and even developing stem cells from animal egg cells.

Although there are a great many factors to consider when drawing up a population estimate, the primary issue is the density in a territory. This is defined as the number of residents per square kilometre or 0.00002300. To determine the density of a settlement, look at the area of each county which contains more than about 0.5% of the population. For example, a small county of 4,000 individuals contains just under 400,000 residents. That means that in most counties of 0.5% density of population, the area is less than the city density limit of 1,000 individuals per square kilometre.

However, in the Islamic communities we live in, as it relates to women being married to men who they believe are abattoirs, there is a very clear distinction that the women have an obligation not to live or to perform the required Islamic rite (dauk) and the men don't.\n\nThis has to do with Muslim women's status in Islam and their relationship to Muslims in general.\n\nSo, when they're married and a dauk is performed, the religious head of the community says that they can't perform it or there is no dauk in this community.

He left the island a leader of stability and national unity, and in the eyes of a skeptical media, a man who seemed to wield a little bit too much power.\n\nRatsiraka has said that he is not involved in any of the current conflict and neither is the military. He says that the conflict began because politicians of other parties wanted to make political gains and that his own party, which he took over from Lolo Joko, the late president of the country, has been weak.\n\nOn March 4, a statement said that \"with the arrival of the UN, a decision will be made on a formal resolution on the armed conflict in the Faroe Islands.\"\n\nA day later Ratsiraka said he had not officially stepped down and did not see any political benefit from it.",

    "Currently, copper wires transfer information in a computer; the process is slowed down as the wires heat up. \"Photonic\" and \"spintronic\" are two technologies that may be able to handle the high frequency vibrations of tiny magnets, but their speed limitations would make them prohibitively costly.\n\nThe study found that at least 3D printing could meet existing needs, although the technology could also eventually replace other manufacturing methods. Using silicon as the printing material, for instance, could allow for smaller pieces to fit into a larger enclosure.\n\nA key limitation of the current setup is that the small, nonmagnetic material needs a strong magnetic field around it. That requires a laser to make the parts stretch and stabilize themselves. \"We might build a magnetic printable material,\" said co-first author and graduate student Matthew P. Epplin, director of the materials division at Penn State, in a press release .\n\nMagnetic levitations would allow the printed objects to travel",
