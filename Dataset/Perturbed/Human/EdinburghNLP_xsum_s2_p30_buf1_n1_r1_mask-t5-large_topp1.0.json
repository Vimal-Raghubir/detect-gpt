But ministers have been slow to meet agreed European Commission targets for cutting levels of harmful chemicals NO2. This comes mainly from vehicles. It can worsen lung disease and also interfere with breathing - particularly for people with heart or lung problems. The UK has been denied a ruling by the commission to delay emissions improvements in 12 areas - Aberdeen and north-east Scotland; Belfast; Birkenhead; Brighton; Bristol; Liverpool; Preston; Sheffield; south-west England; and Swansea and Tyneside. A judgement will be made at a later date on government plans to delay meeting NO2 standards in major cities until 2020 - or, in the case of London, 2025. London has the worst air of any EU capital , and the UK is likely to be fined over the delay. National air pollution is recognised by the government as the second-biggest public health threat,"

Greg Hands, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, has travelled to Edinburgh for the meeting with Finance Secretary John Swinney. Both ministers have said they are hoping for a positive outcome from the talks. They need to agree a framework for the devolution of new tax and welfare powers contained in the Scotland Bill. The First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said she would only back a new Westminster Government if the House of Commons approved a new deal . With new tax powers, there is a risk Scotland could find itself worse off, with the Treasury cutting the block grant by more than is raised. The Scottish Government has said this will be the biggest transfer of powers to date and they are determined to deliver a fair and lasting settlement for the people of Scotland."

Despite involving more soldiers and having higher casualties, it is overshadowed by Bosworth, which saw the death of Richard III three months earlier.

But it suggests other health and lifestyle factors also have an important role to play in bringing blood pressures down. The work appears in the Lancet. High blood pressure has long been linked to a higher risk of heart disease and stroke. Current guidelines issued by England's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommend that patients should only take medication when their blood pressure levels reach 140 mmHg. Until this advice is changed, those at highest risk, for example people who have had strokes, are offered monitoring but are denied therapy. Now a global team of leading experts are calling for doctors to focus on an individual's risks rather than rigid and \"arbitrary\" blood pressure thresholds. Experts analysed the findings of more than 100 studies involving some 600,000 people between 1966 and 2015. They found those patients at highest risk - including"

A cluster of five primary feeder schools has been approved by the council, but others involving feeder schools to academies in Farr, Sutherland, Lochalsh and Inverness have been deferred. However, the current set up involves the clustering of eight feeder schools. Further consultation is to take place on a cluster involving Kinlochbervie High School. Approved at a meeting of the council's education committee were the creation of clusters of feeder schools to six secondary schools - Dornoch, Kilchuimen, Lochaber in Fort William, Plockton and Millburn in Inverness. Education chief Jim Stephen said the move was not about saving money, but about enhancing pupils' education. The local authority has considered more closely recruiting head teachers to some schools.

The tiny beads are added to hundreds of whitening products to help remove dead skin cells. But researchers have now warned that microplastics are entering human food via cosmetic pollution in Welsh waters.

      "Geno Smith and newcomer Ikemefuna Enemkpali got into an altercation inside the team's facility on Tuesday, Jets Coach Todd Bowles said. \"It had nothing to do with football,\" Bowles said of the fight. \"It was something very childish.\" Enemkpali, a relative newcomer, lost his balance right after landing the punch. \"You don't walk up to another man and punch him in the head,\" Bowles said. The team was training for the upcoming American football season, which starts later this month, but Smith is expected to miss several games. Smith, who has been battling hard to become the team's starting quarterback, will need surgery to fix his jaw. With Smith sidelined, the team's other quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick will have to assume the starting role. Later on Tuesday, Smith posted a closed-mouthed photo on Instagram with the caption \"I'll be back\"."

      "The rate of growth marks a sharp slowdown from 4.9% growth recorded in the previous quarter. The US Commerce department said one reason for the slower growth was a slowdown in consumer spending. Export growth was also slower compared with the previous quarter after a strong dollar made US goods more expensive for companies outside the country. Energy sector investment continued to plummet, with spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts down 38.7%, a slightly less dramatic decline than the 47% drop seen in the third quarter. Overall, investment in the sector was down 35% in 2015, the largest drop since 1986. Unseasonably mild weather held back some consumer spending, with another brake coming from manufacturers who chose to run down surplus stock rather than make new goods. Both factors are seen as contributing to the US economy 's weak growth. US growth was 2.4% in 2015, and is expected to pick up steam to give a similar growth figure this year.

The set-up cost was just $60 (\u00c2\u00a340), he said. This device created phantom objects - primarily walls and pedestrians - that fool the \"eyes\" of vehicle autonomous systems - known as lidars. \"You can spoof thousands of objects and basically carry out a denial of service for the system so it's not able to track real objects,\" Mr Petit told IEEE Spectrum. \"I can take echoes of a fake car and put them at any location I want,\" he added."

Dr Trevor Dines, botanical director of the charity, said more than 97% of meadows had been destroyed in England since the 1930s, with road verges becoming the main source of habitat for wildlife such as butterflies and other insects. \"Most of the country is now hostile to many of our wild plants and other wildlife due to the loss of wild flower meadows by the use of herbicides and fertilisers,\" he told BBC News. \"The roadside verges are often the last refuge for wild flowers and wildlife to survive on them. \"It's as if plants have been removed from their own gardens and pushed out of farmland and now"

Ofcom said the fine reflected \"the seriousness\" of their actions. TalkTalk said it was \"disappointed at the scale of the fine\".

The talented football player was jailed for two nights in Kuta this week after being found with a small bag of white powder at a nightclub. Police suspected it was cocaine but forensic tests revealed the powder did not contain any illegal drugs. Indonesian authorities also confirmed no drugs were detected in Mr Murphy's blood or urine. Around 1,500 Australians have been banned from obtaining drugs at this time of the year, as part of high school graduation celebrations known as \"schoolies\". Kuta police chief Wayan Sumara said Mr Murphy was \"very lucky\" after the forensic tests came back negative. He had faced the possibility of 12 years in jail and a fine of A$800,000 (\u00c2\u00a3500,000, $600,000). Lawyers for Mr Murphy denied police claims he had had an affair with an Indonesian man involved in buying the white powder. Australian media broadcast footage showing Mr Murphy, with his eyes closed, being restrained around the head by a nightclub security guard."

Linfield manager Kevin Devine will probably wonder how his team managed to lose the game.

The four-times major winner ended four shots off the cut mark at Erin Hills, as did compatriot Graeme McDowell, who added a 73 to his final total. McIlroy was playing just his seventh tournament of the summer due to a rib injury. He won the US Open with a record 16-under-par total in 2011, but missed the cut at Oakmont last year following rounds of 77 and 71. The 28-year-old needed to make a fast start on Friday to avoid another early exit, but missed from five feet for birdie on the 10th hole in his opening round and 12 feet on the final hole before a poor chip from the back of the green"

      "Andrew Beaumont posted a picture on Twitter of the parliamentary hopefuls alongside his ballot papers for the Oxford West and Oxford East West seat. The 34-year-old father of two, a bursar at Oxford University's Hertford College, says he hopes his figures will shake up the final bit of campaigning. Conservative candidate Nicola Blackwood is defending a majority of the seat. Dr Beaumont, who describes himself as a \"Lego obsessive and sometime c.18th historian\" on Twitter, told BBC News he came up with the creations \"out of boredom\". \"I got all the literature and the manifestos through the door and when I was reading the seven candidates and looking at their mugshots, I just thought they all looked a bit the same,\" he said. \"That's where the idea to recreate them in Lego came from really. I took a look at my ballot paper and thought , well, I thought it might be a bit of fun to pair"

      "About 50 firefighters remain at the six-storey building on Heritage Way, after the blaze broke out on the top floor at about 04:00 BST on Sunday. People living in 120 flats were evacuated, with many spending the night in a rescue centre or a local hotel. All the residents were evacuated, with no injuries reported.

Warriors are aiming to reach Euro 2020 for the first time. Townsend's side can do so with wins over the Pool 1 leaders at Scotstoun and Leicester on 21 January. \"It's a very tight campaign and we do have two games left,\" the head coach added. \"Obviously, if we have aspirations of winning the Pool then we've got to win both our games and this game is the most important one for us. \"Munster are one of the best sides in the Pool just now; it's a home game and a chance for us to win a big game ahead of a huge game on Saturday at Leicester. \"Normally your target is four or five games - four games minimum to get out of the Pool - so, if we"

      "Officers were contacted at 10:30 local time (18:30 GMT) on Saturday about the alleged incident at the Palms Resort Casino and Spa, according to Lt Jeff Goodwin. A police statement said an altercation took place in the hotel room when a woman tried to take photos of Brown and was struck by him before he took her phone. His publicist Nicole Perna called the charges \"unequivocally untrue\". Police said they were unable to speak to Brown at his hotel room as he had left before they arrived.

      "The move follows talks between the union and employer Babcock Marine. Industrial action began in March, following union claims that Babcock was \"undermining\" workers' rights as part of a campaign to outsource work. Unite said the decision to withdraw industrial action was made after a two-day workshop by shop stewards who met senior Babcock representatives. The union said a proposed new accord between Unite and Babcock would be put to a mass meeting of union members on Tuesday. Unite said the shop stewards are recommending that it should be accepted. Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said talks with senior executives from Babcock on Monday had been productive. Unite West Midlands regional officer Stephen Deans added: \"As always, it's our members who will make the decision on whether this accord goes far enough in meeting their concerns, but Unite believes it is a solid foundation to build a better partnership in the future.\" The shipwreck on the Clyde River is home to the UK's fleet of Trident nuclear submarines.
